## Our Mission

Active Monrovia is dedicated to promoting safe, accessible, and sustainable active transportation options for all Monrovia residents. We believe that walking, biking, and rolling are not just recreational activities but vital transportation options that contribute to healthier individuals, stronger communities, and a cleaner environment.

## Our Vision

We envision a Monrovia where:

- People of all ages and abilities can safely travel by foot, bike, or other non-motorized means
- Active transportation is integrated with public transit to create a robust, sustainable transportation network
- Streets are designed to accommodate all users, not just cars
- Children can safely walk or bike to school
- Residents can easily access parks, shops, and services without relying on cars

## Our Work

### Advocacy

We advocate for policies and infrastructure that support active transportation, including:

- Implementation of the Monrovia Bicycle Master Plan
- Complete Streets policies
